<analysis>
HexaBid is an AI-powered Tender ERP SaaS that automates the discovery, analysis, and management of public tenders for Indian contractors, OEMs, and service providers.
It integrates AI/ML, document automation, and competitive intelligence into a single cloud platform optimized for lightweight deployment (AWS Free Tier or small VPS).

The project evolved from a concept prototype into a production-grade multi-module web app, shifting through multiple hosting iterations — from BigRock VPS → AlmaLinux aaPanel → Vercel+Render split → final AWS EC2 economy deployment.

The current state reflects a fully integrated build (frontend + backend + AI services), structured for scalable SaaS delivery.
