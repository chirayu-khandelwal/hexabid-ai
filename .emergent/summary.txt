The trajectory details the development of the HexaBid ERP system. Initially, the AI engineer clarified Emergent's hosting and pricing models, outlining a phased development approach for the complex ERP. The user then provided detailed requirements, leading to the iterative construction of the full-stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) application. Key development phases included building core modules, expanding to 15+ modules with AI subsystems, integrating a GeM portal scraper and document preparation, and finally, configuring essential production services like email, WhatsApp alerts, and payment gateways. The process involved extensive file creation, modifications, service restarts, and documentation generation, with GitHub export and VPN deployment as overarching goals. The AI is currently setting up deployment scripts and service modules.
